# Kidney Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project is an introductory implementation of machine learning techniques for detecting kidney diseases, created as part of the **Introduction to Health Informatics** subject. It utilizes Python and popular ML libraries to predict the presence of kidney disease based on clinical parameters.

## Project Overview
Kidney disease is a critical health issue that requires early detection and treatment. This project leverages machine learning to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of kidney disease, potentially aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosis.

## Features
- Preprocessing and cleaning clinical data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature relationships.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.
- Model evaluation and selection based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains clinical parameters such as blood pressure, glucose levels, age, and more. These features are used to train the model to predict kidney disease.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vishalkumarojha/intro-to-helth-info-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd intro-to-helth-info-project
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the machine learning model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Test the model and view the results:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```


```

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of XX% with [selected algorithm].
- Insights from EDA revealed key factors influencing kidney disease.
